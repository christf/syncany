Syncany [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/binwiederhier/syncany.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/binwiederhier/syncany) 
=======
> **Important:** Please be aware that this is still ALPHA code! Do not use it
                 for important files.

Syncany is an open-source cloud storage and filesharing application. It allows
users to backup and share certain folders of their workstations using any kind
of storage, e.g. FTP, Amazon S3 or Google Storage.

While the basic idea is similar to Dropbox and JungleDisk, Syncany is
open-source and additionally provides data encryption and more flexibility in
terms of storage type and provider:

- **Data encryption**: Syncany encrypts the files locally, so that any online
  storage can be used even for sensitive data.  
- **Any storage**: Syncany uses a plug-in based storage system. It can
  be used with any type of remote storage.

Download and install daily snapshots
------------------------------------
We're building snapshots of the latest master-branch commit as soon as they are committed (older snapshots
are removed). At the moment, the build process outputs a \*.tar.gz and a \*.zip archive, as well as
an executable for Windows (\*.exe installer) and a Debian/Ubuntu package (\*.deb).

**To download it, check out the [latest builds](http://syncany.org/dist/)!**  
The corresponding [JavaDoc](http://syncany.org/docs/javadoc/) and the
[JUnit test reports](http://syncany.org/reports/) is also available.

**Please note**: These builds are created from *unstable*, sometimes *erroneous* code. 
Things might change very often and newer versions might not support older repositories.
Please **do NOT** use these builds for important files.

Sample usage
------------

Usage is pretty similar to a version control system. If you have used Git or
SVN, it should feel a lot alike.

**1. Initialize a local directory**

        $ syncany init 
        
        Choose a storage plugin. Available plugins are: ftp, local, s3
        Plugin: ftp
        
        Connection details for FTP connection:
        - hostname: myhost.example.com
        - username: myuser1
        - password: somepassword1
        - port (optional):

        The password is used to encrypt data on the remote storage.
        Please choose it wisely.

        Password: (secret password)
        Confirm: (repeat it)
        
This sets up a new repository on the given remote storage and initializes the
local folder. You can now use `syncany connect` to connect to this repository
from other clients.

**2. Add files and synchronize**

To let Syncany do everything automatically, simple use the `syncany watch` command. 
This command will synchronize your local files. 

        $ syncany watch 

You can also manually trigger the upload of your local files or the download of remote changes:

        $ syncany up
        $ syncany down

For a detailed demo, please refer to a [screencast](#documentation-diagrams-and-screencasts). 


Build and test Syncany
----------------------

**0. Requirements**: Syncany is based on Java 7 and we use Gradle for dependency management
and as build tool. Gradle does all the dependency magic. All you need to build Syncany
is a **JDK 7**. If you like to create a Debian package (optional), you also need
[FPM](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) installed.

On a Debian-based system that would be:

        $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
   
And optional for building Debian packages (*debian* task):

        $ sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev build-essential rubygems
        $ sudo gem install fpm

**1. Checkout code and build**

        git clone http://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany
        cd syncany        
        ./gradlew installApp         (on Linux / Mac OS)
        gradlew installApp           (on Windows)

This compiles and installs the Syncany command line client to 
`syncany-cli/build/install/syncany/bin/syncany`. You can run it from there.

**2. Install command line client (to run `syncany` from anywhere)**

To be able to run `syncany` (or short: `sy`) from anywhere, you can install a 
symbolic link on your system. On Linux, the link is placed in `/usr/local/bin`,
on Windows, a batch file is placed in `C:\Windows`. To do this, run the
following commands:

*On Linux / Mac OS:*

        sudo ./gradlew fakeinstall   (on Linux / Mac OS)
        
*On Windows:*
  - Click *Start*, type `cmd`, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. If a warning appears, click *Yes*.
  - In the command box, `cd` to your checkout directory and run `gradlew fakeinstall`
        
Please note: There is no easy way to permanently install Syncany on your system, 
yet. We're working on an installer for Windows, and packages for Linux.
        
**3. Run it!**

        syncany --help

**Generated JavaDoc and JUnit Reports**    
The up-to-date JavaDoc of the master branch is always compiled to [syncany.org/docs/javadoc](http://syncany.org/docs/javadoc). It includes the JavaDoc of all Gradle
modules in the repo. All results of the JUnit tests are compiled to [syncany.org/reports](http://syncany.org/reports/). The corresponding distributables for this code are located at [syncany.org/dist](http://syncany.org/dist/).


Setup Eclipse IDE for development
---------------------------------

1. Checkout Syncany on the command line: 

        cd /home/user/workplace
        git clone http://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany
        cd syncany
        
2. Generate Eclipse project files and download dependencies:

        ./gradlew eclipse      (on Linux / Mac OS)
        gradlew eclipse        (on Windows)   

3. Open Eclipse and create a new workplace, e.g. at "/home/user/workplace"
   
4. In Eclipse: File -> Import -> Existing Projects Into Workplace
   -> Select Root Directory --> Browse
   
   - Select "/home/user/workplace/syncany"
   - [x] Tick the *Search nested projects* checkbox (only available in *Eclipse Kepler*)
   
5. Click "Finish"


How can I help?
---------------
If you'd like to help developing Syncany, there are a few ways to do so.

1. **TODO markers**: The Java code contains lots of `TODO` markers, classified in *high*,
   *medium* and *low*. Using the *Tasks* tab in Eclipse, pick one or two and start coding. To get
   started, check out the *Setup Eclipse* section above.

2. **Issues, features and tasks**: Besides the markers in the code, there are lots of other things 
   that need doing. There is an always up-to-date list in the 
   [issue tracker](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues) with the label
   [status:help-needed](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues?labels=status%3Ahelp-needed).

If you have questions, feel free to ask. There are maaaany ways to do so. Check out the section below!
